      <p>The MuseumXDesign Project is centred around identity and how it connects to the past.</p>
      <p>On the first day, we brainstormed on what identity means and how we identify ourselves.</p>
      <p>On the second we brought in the item we consider the most important to us. I chose my ipad. We looked around the Korea and had to choose an item that related to our own object. I chose ancient Korean coins. We then took photos of both objects and  of ourselves.</p>
