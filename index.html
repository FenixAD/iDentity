      <h3>The MuseumXDesign Project is centred around identity and how it connects to the past.</h3>
      <h4>On the first day...</h4>
      <p>...we brainstormed on what identity means and how we identify ourselves.</p>
      <h4>On the second day...</h4>
      <p>...we brought in the item we consider the most important to us. I chose my ipad. We looked around the Korea and had to choose an item that related to our own object. I chose ancient Korean coins. We then took photos of both objects and  of ourselves.</p>

      <h4>On the third day...</h4>
      <p>...we used photoshop to create an image/poster, incorperating our photography into it.</p>

      <h3>It was facinating to do this because you never really stop and consider how technology of today can relate to something from an Ancient Era.</h3>
      <h2>So how do Korean Mun (ancient coins) relate to iPads?</h2>
      <p>These coins are circular with a square hole in the middle. My friend noticed the visual connection since the coing looks like a home button or the lens of a camera (which was her item)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Both items are made of metal</li>
        <li>They have the symbol of their creators, which are easy to reconise</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The connection went furthur when we realised that having an iPad or a HD camera is a sign of wealth. Apple products are representative of expensive technology, which is why ancient currency links with our items.</p>
      <p>Not to mention, coins like Korean mun that had holes in them could be worn together as a necklace. It's a status sign that can't be missed, just like our technology in modern day.</p>
      <p>It's just another thing that makes up your identity.</p>
